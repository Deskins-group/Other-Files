# OtherFiles
Here are scripts to help form polarons using the Bond Distortion Method discussed in our recent paper XYZ. Two files exist, one that processes VASP POSCAR files, and one that processes cartesian xyz files. Currently neither script considers periodic boundary conditions, so be sure to place the polaron near the center of the simulation cell.


- **mendeley-tags-from-bib.py** A script to process a bib file exported from Mendeley to generate a list of Mendeley tags.
- **pair-sort-todo.py** A script to compare items in a text file (todo items) and rank them by priority.
- **reaction-graph.py** A script to take a list of reaction energies for a reaction mechanism and create a list of reaction energies that are spaced out in order to make common reaction plot.
